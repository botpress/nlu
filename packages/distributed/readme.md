# Botpress Distributed

Contains distributed locks and distributed queues

## Locks

Locks prevent multiple types of race conditions. Race conditions can occur:

- in single-threaded apps when using asynchronous code
- in multi-threaded/multi-process apps
- in mutli-instances apps

## Queues

A Distributed Task Queue can run tasks on multiple instances without the need for a master slave configuration.
